- Each folder represents one automation blueprint + instructions.
- JSON files are importable into Make.com (or similar).
- `instructions.md` within each folder details step-by-step setup for that automation.
- Screenshots or visuals should be placed in each automation folder (e.g. `images/` subfolder).

---

## ✅ Setup Guide (for a given automation folder)

1. Open the folder (e.g. `linkedin-latest-jobs`)  
2. Follow its `instructions.md` — ideally the steps are consistent across automations.  
3. Replace placeholder URLs, keys, and connections with your own (RSS feed, OpenAI key, Google Sheets, etc.).  
4. Import the `.json` blueprint into your automation tool (Make.com, etc.).  
5. Run a test to verify data flow end-to-end.

---

## ✍️ Prompt Templates

Each automation includes a prompt template used inside the OpenAI module.  
You’re free to tweak it, add more fields, or adjust formatting — just ensure the JSON schema aligns with your sheet/target.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Troubleshooting

- Use sample data with just a couple of items to test flow.
- Check execution history in Make.com (or your tool) to see failures or mapping issues.
- Confirm the output JSON fields exactly match your Google Sheets headers.
- Watch for API rate limits or malformed responses.

---

## 🗓️ Roadmap & Future Features

- Add more LinkedIn automations (e.g. auto-post, comment analyzer).  
- Expand beyond LinkedIn (e.g. Twitter, GitHub, job boards).  
- Make a central dashboard to run and monitor all automations.  
- Add retry logic, error alerts, logging, and versioning.
